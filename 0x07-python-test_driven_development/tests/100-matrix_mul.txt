"""
Multiplies two matrices m_a and m_b.

Args:
m_a (list): First matrix as a list of lists of integers or floats.
m_b (list): Second matrix as a list of lists of integers or floats.

Raises:
TypeError: If m_a or m_b is not a list, not a list of lists, not a rectangle, or can't be multiplied.
ValueError: If m_a or m_b is empty or if one element of the list of lists is not an integer or a float.

Returns:
list: The resulting matrix after multiplying m_a and m_b.

Example:
>>> matrix_mul = __import__('100-matrix_mul').matrix_mul
>>> a = [[3, 2, 1, 5], [9, 1, 3, 0]]
>>> b = [[2, 9, 0], [1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 7], [8, 1, 5]]
>>> matrix_mul(a, b)
[[50, 42, 42], [25, 96, 26]]
>>> a = 2
>>> b = [[2, 9, 0], [1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 7], [8, 1, 5]]
