"""
Multiplies two matrices m_a and m_b using the NumPy module.

Args:
m_a (list): First matrix as a list of lists of integers or floats.
m_b (list): Second matrix as a list of lists of integers or floats.

Raises:
TypeError: If m_a or m_b is not a list, not a list of lists, not a rectangle, or can't be multiplied.
ValueError: If m_a or m_b is empty or if one element of the list of lists is not an integer or a float.

Returns:
numpy.ndarray: The resulting matrix after multiplying m_a and m_b.

Example:
>>> lazy_matrix_mul([[1, 2], [3, 4]], [[5, 6], [7, 8]])
array([[19, 22],
[43, 50]])
