 """
    Divides all elements of a matrix by a given number.

    Args:
        matrix (list of lists): The matrix to be divided.
        div (int or float): The number to divide the matrix elements by.

    Returns:
        list of lists: The new matrix with elements divided by 'div', rounded to 2 decimal places.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If matrix is not a list of lists of integers or floats, or if div is not a number (integer or float).
        TypeError: If each row of the matrix does not have the same size.
        ZeroDivisionError: If div is equal to 0.

    Examples:
        >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
        >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
        [[0.5, 1.0, 1.5], [2.0, 2.5, 3.0]]

        >>> matrix = [[1.5, 2.5, 3.5], [4.5, 5.5, 6.5]]
        >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
        [[0.75, 1.25, 1.75], [2.25, 2.75, 3.25]]

        >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]
        >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
        TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

        >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, "five", 6]]
        >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
        TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

        >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
        >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 0)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
        ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
